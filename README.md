# Defender Control
Open source windows defender disabler.   
Now you can disable windows defender permanently!   

## What is this project?  
We all know that disabling windefender is a pain going through countless registries & running endless powershell commands.  
The next easiest solution is to use freeware and currently the most popular one is by sordum.  
But I like open source, so I made a safe to use open source defender control.

Please note the release only disables defender at the moment.  
I will release a version that enables it in the near future.
