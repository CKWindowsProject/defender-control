# Defender Control
Open source windows defender disabler.   
Now you can disable windows defender permanently!   

## What is this project?  
We all know that disabling windefender is very difficult since microsoft is constantly enforcing changes.   
The next easiest solution is to use freeware thats already available on the internet - but none of them are native & open source...  
I like open source, so I made a safe to use open source defender control.
